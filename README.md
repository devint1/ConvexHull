# ConvexHull

This program was developed by me for CSCE 411: Design and Analysis of Algorithms. It computes the convex hull of a set of randomly generated points using either Graham's Scan or Jarvis' March. Multiple iterations can be specified to measure the performance of the two algorithms.

## Compiling
```
javac *.java
```

## Running
```
java ConvexHull <points> <iterations> <display> <algorithm>
```
